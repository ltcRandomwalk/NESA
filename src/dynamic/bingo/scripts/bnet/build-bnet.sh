# Given a project path, runs the commands that must be run before driver.py can be invoked. This includes pruning the
# constraints in named_cons_all.txt, turning named_cons_all.txt.pruned into a Bayesian network, and finally turning
# named-bnet.out into factor-graph.fg which is readable by driver.py.

# Arguments:
# 1. Project path, in a format recognized by list.sh, and eventually by runner.pl.
# 2. Augment dir: "augment" or "noaugment", suffixed with any string, in which the BN will be built.
#                 This will also indicate to prune-cons whether or not to augment the forward constraints while pruning.
#                 The second part of the name is merely a convention: it indicates the list of queries used as
#                 base_queries.txt while performing prune-cons.
#                 Ex: noaugment_or_thr means that prune-cons will not augment (because of the noaugment prefix) 
#                     and the BN will be placed in the directory noaugment_or_thr. The or_thr suffix indicates, again by
#                     convention, that the k-obj=3-sensitive oracle with thread escape was used as the set of queries to
#                     to be ranked.
# 3. rule-prob.txt, file mapping rule names to probabilities.

# Intended to be run from the main Bingo directory.
# ./scripts/bnet/build-bnet.sh pjbench/ftp noaugment_base rule-prob.txt
